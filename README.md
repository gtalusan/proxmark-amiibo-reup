Proxmark3 script to simulate an Amiibo dump with a randomly generated UID.

Press the pm3 button to stop simulating the current UID and rotate to the next one.  Ctrl-C to abort.

This allows for "infinite" re-ups of an Amiibo's rewards if there are daily limits.

Requires recent proxmark3 Iceman fork with hf_mfu_amiibo scripts.

To install, copy to ~/.proxmark3/luascripts.
