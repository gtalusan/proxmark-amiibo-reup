Randomly generates a new UID given an Amiibo dump and pipes it to Proxmark3 (Iceman's repo) for simulation.

Press the pm3 button to stop simulating the current UID and rotate to the next one.  Ctrl-C to abort.

This allows for "infinite" re-ups of an Amiibo's rewards if there are daily limits.

Requires PyAmiibo and its dependencies, in particular, the unfixed-info and locked-secret binary keys.
